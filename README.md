Personal new tab page with bookmarks, weather, quote, and gradient background.

The background gradient randomizes on page load, as does the quote.

Weather comes from [monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather](https://github.com/monkeecreate/jquery.simpleWeather).

It also has keyboard navigation thanks to [ccampbell/mousetrap](https://github.com/ccampbell/mousetrap)!

Press the spacebar to change background, quote, greeting, and refresh weather. Each category is openable by keyboard and click, press escape to close all.

In Chrome, you can go to Extensions and tick Developer mode, then drag-and-drop Start.crx into that window to have this as your new tab page. Magic! [[ EDIT : Fix By Me, Open a new tab with _blank target ]]

You could also use [New Tab Override for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/), or [Custom New Tab Page for Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/custom-new-tab-page/) to set this as your new tab page in those browsers.

Browse similar style pages on [/r/startpages](https://reddit.com/r/startpages).

BTW, it's super fast. DOMContentLoaded of ~225ms (~150ms as an extension!!) :D
